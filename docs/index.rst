Welcome to SheetShow's documentation!
=====================================

SheetShow is a simple renderer for sheet diagrams, which represent morphisms
in `bimonoidal categories <https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/rig+category>`_ (also known as rig categories).

Morphisms are defined in a YAML format which is translated by the renderer as vector graphics
(in the SVGÂ format) suitable for inclusion in academic articles.

For more information about the theory behind these diagrams, refer to:

* Cole Comfort, Antonin Delpeuch and Jules Hedges. Sheet diagrams for bimonoidal categories. `arXiv:2010.13361 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13361>`_.
