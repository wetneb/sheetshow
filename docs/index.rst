Welcome to SheetShow's documentation!
=====================================

SheetShow is a simple renderer for sheet diagrams, which represent morphisms
in `bimonoidal categories <https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/rig+category>`_ (also known as rig categories).

Morphisms are defined in a YAML format which is translated by the renderer as vector graphics
(in the SVGÂ format) suitable for inclusion in academic articles.
